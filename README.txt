#Read Me — PROKOP Data Science ML Models Project Report

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of the following machine learning models:  Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Please view the ML_Models html or ipynb to view the source code (html contains all cell outputs, the ipynb requires a lot of computational power to execute).

Review the ML_Models_Report for the full report and explanation of the results.
